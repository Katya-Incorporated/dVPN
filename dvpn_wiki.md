## üß© Introduction

dVPN is a decentralized, peer-to-peer VPN solution aimed at ensuring maximum privacy, data sovereignty, and resilience against surveillance or censorship. Built with modern cryptographic practices and community-driven governance, dVPN is designed for use in both individual and enterprise-grade applications.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Fully decentralized VPN network
- Zero-knowledge privacy model
- Onion-style multi-hop routing
- Open-source and community-driven
- Integrated token-based node incentivization
- Anti-censorship and geo-unblocking capabilities

---

## üèó Architecture Overview

```
[Client Device] -> [Entry Node] -> [Relay Nodes]* -> [Exit Node] -> [Destination]
```

- **Entry Node**: Accepts encrypted user traffic.
- **Relay Nodes**: Optionally used for multiple hops to increase privacy.
- **Exit Node**: Decrypts and forwards the request to the final destination.
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Handles payments, reputation, and node registry.

---

## üõ† Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js & npm or yarn
- Docker (optional for quick deployment)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Katya-Incorporated/dVPN.git
cd dVPN
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the dVPN Node

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## üß™ Usage Guide

1. Launch the dVPN GUI or CLI.
2. Select the entry node and route preferences.
3. Connect to the decentralized network.
4. Browse anonymously and securely.

---

## üîí Security and Privacy

- End-to-end encryption
- Zero logs policy
- Decentralized authentication and identity
- Support for Tor and I2P routing (optional)

---

## üß¨ Integration with Katya OS

dVPN is natively integrated with Katya OS to provide:

- One-click connection via system settings
- Auto-routing through trusted dVPN nodes
- Integration with Katya Identity for secure credential management
- Seamless protection of system-wide traffic across all Katya-native apps

---

## üí∏ Tokenomics for Node Operators

Node operators earn utility tokens for:

- Uptime and stability
- Bandwidth contributed
- Latency and speed performance

Token rewards are distributed via a smart contract with transparent staking and withdrawal mechanisms. Operators must:

- Register their node on-chain
- Stake a minimum token amount for reputation
- Follow network compliance policies (see GitHub docs)

---

## üß∞ API Reference

### Authentication
```
POST /api/authenticate
```
**Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`  
**Body**:
```json
{
  "username": "user",
  "password": "password"
}
```

### Node Status
```
GET /api/nodes/status
```
Returns JSON with real-time status of all nodes.

### Route Configuration
```
POST /api/route/set
```
**Body**:
```json
{
  "entry": "node1",
  "exit": "node3",
  "hops": ["node2"]
}
```

For more endpoints, refer to `docs/api.md`.

---

## üì¶ SDK Documentation

The dVPN SDK enables developers to integrate dVPN functionality directly into applications.

### SDK Installation
```bash
npm install @katya/dvpn-sdk
```

### Basic Usage
```js
import { connectVPN, disconnectVPN } from '@katya/dvpn-sdk';

await connectVPN({
  entry: 'node1',
  exit: 'node3',
  hops: ['node2'],
});

// later
await disconnectVPN();
```

### SDK Features
- Node discovery and connection
- Session tracking
- Token staking for app developers

## üìë Protocol Whitepaper

The dVPN protocol defines:

- **Trustless Routing**: No single node can decrypt the full payload.
- **On-chain Governance**: Community decisions managed via DAO mechanisms.
- **Node Reputation**: Weighted by historical performance, uptime, and feedback.
- **Privacy Guarantees**: Zero-knowledge proofs for identity and usage.

The full whitepaper is available at: [docs/whitepaper.md](https://github.com/Katya-Incorporated/dVPN/blob/main/docs/whitepaper.md)
